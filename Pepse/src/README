Question 1:
The different classes i added to the project are:
1.The class "Leaf" - The class represents an individual leaf in a tree within the game's environment.
It is both a `GameObject`, making it an interactable object within the game world,
and an `AvatarJumpListener`, meaning it listens for and reacts to the avatar's jump action.
The leaf object is in constant movement that mimics the wind this is done using two transitions one to rotate
the leaf back and forth and one to change the width, when the avatar jumps another transition is initiated to
rotate the leaf 90 degrees.
2.The class "Fruit" - The class represents an individual Fruit in a tree within the game's environment,
It is both a `GameObject`, making it an interactable object within the game world,
and an `AvatarJumpListener`, meaning it listens for and reacts to the avatar's jump action.
The fruit can detect a collision with the avatar, when this happens the fruit becomes invisible and 10 energy
points are added to the avatar. after 30 seconds the fruit becomes visible again, this is done with a
scheduled task. When the avatar jumps the fruit changes color to a random color for a list of colors.
3.The class "Tree" - The class represents a tree within the game's environment. It is both a `GameObject`,
making it an interactable object within the game world, and an `AvatarJumpListener`,
meaning it listens for and reacts to the avatar's jump action.
The tree is made up of a trunk and a canopy, the trunk is a rectangle and the canopy is made up of a number
of leaves and fruits, the tree randomly generates the number of leaves and fruits within the canopy.
when the avatar jumps the trunk of the tree changes color to a random color variation of brown.
4. The class "Flora" - The class is in charge of creating the trees in the game, it does this by
going along the x axis of the world, randomly generating a number and if the number is bellow a threshold
it creates a tree, the class knows not to spawn a tree on top of the avatar by receiving it's
staring location.


Question 2:
The Tree class is the central class of the package, acting as an aggregate for the components
that make up a tree. It manages the Leaf and Fruit objects, organizing them around the tree's structure.
When a Tree instance is instantiated, it determines the placement of its leaves and fruits relative to
its own position. This organization establishes a clear hierarchical relationship,
with Tree at the top, and Leaf and Fruit as dependents.

The Leaf class represents individual leaves, each with its own set of properties and behaviors,
making them independent objects within the game world.
Although they are managed by the Tree, leaves do not directly interact with fruits or other trees.
their behaviors are self-contained.

Similarly, the Fruit class represents the fruit objects that can be interacted with by the player's avatar.
Like leaves, fruits maintain their own state and behavior, including their response to being collected
by the player.

The Flora class functions as a factory or a generator for trees within the game world.
It is responsible for creating Tree instances and placing them within the game environment. It determines
the location where each tree should be instantiated and passes that location to the Tree constructor.
The Flora class ensures that trees are distributed throughout the game in a manner that appears natural and
aligns with the game's terrain, as dictated by the groundHeightAt function.


Question 3:
The Leaf, Tree, and Fruit classes each implement the AvatarJumpListener functional interface,
embracing the observer design pattern.
This design allows these elements to be observers of the avatar's jump events. Once instances of these
classes are instantiated, they are registered to the avatar's jumpListeners array. Consequently, whenever the
avatar jumps, it invokes the notifyJumpListeners method, which iterates through the array of listeners and
calls their onAvatarJump method. This results in each leaf, fruit, and tree to respond to the avatar's jump.
